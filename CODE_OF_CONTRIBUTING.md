## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your work:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

2. Make your changes in code or documentation.

   * Follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python code style.
   * Write clear commit messages using prefixes like `fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`, or `refactor:`.

3. Run tests (if available):

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

4. Push your branch and open a Pull Request (PR):

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```
